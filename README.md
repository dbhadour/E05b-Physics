Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

In *main1.py*, I applied gravity and made the balls fall

*main2.py*,did the same thing but added bounce 

*main3.py* this took a lot of hours. I somehow got the if statment right by studying main2.py but I don't understand the whole concept yet. I am still working on how to make animals collide among themselves too but no progress so far.
